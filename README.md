# ShotGunTheGame
this is a game I created as a mini project in my AP Computer Science class of the handgame ShotGun
In this version, you will be playing against a CPU.
There are four available moves: Shoot, Reflect, Block, and Reload.
This repository has the beginning and the final version.
I added two more levels and at each level, the CPU gets gradually harder for players to beat
