# ShotGunTheGame
this is a game I created as a mini project in my AP Computer Science class of the handgame ShotGun
In this version, you will be playing against a CPU.
There are four available moves: Shoot, Reflect, Block, and Reload.
The future plan is to add addtional levels for a player to choose from. Right now, this is playing with level one.
